MyQuickFav is Chrome extensions that lets you simply manage a list of bookmarks.

= Introduction =

MyQuickFav extensions allow you to save and manage pages in a specific bookmarks folder.

I created it because the Chrome based bookmarks manager is not very usefull to manage reading lists and to mark read/unread pages. It works like the [http://readitlaterlist.com/ Read It Later] extension for Firefox.

= Details =

Two extensions that works separately: 
  * QuickAdd
    # Simply add/remove a page directly from the address bar in your browser. 
  * QuickList
    # Simply view the content of the bookmar folder.
    # Add/remove/view/open a link directly from it.

= Installation =

Simply open the CRX extension file with Google Chrome (>=4.0.266.0).
