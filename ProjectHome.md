MyQuickFav is Chrome extensions that lets you simply manage a list of bookmarks.

# Introduction #

MyQuickFav extensions allow you to save and manage pages in a specific bookmarks folder.

I created it because the Chrome based bookmarks manager is not very usefull to manage reading lists and to mark read/unread pages. It works like the [Read It Later](http://readitlaterlist.com/) extension for Firefox.

# Details #

Two extensions that works separately:
  * QuickAdd
    1. Simply add/remove a page directly from the address bar in your browser.
  * QuickList
    1. Simply view the content of the bookmar folder.
    1. Add/remove/view/open a link directly from it.

# Installation #

Simply open the CRX extension file with Google Chrome (>=4.0.266.0).
